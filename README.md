- 👋 Hi, my name is Felix Pabon-Rodriguez, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science at Indiana University School of Medicine.
- 👀 My biomedical research focuses on Bayesian approaches for within- and between-host modeling of infectious disease processes. His research work includes estimating the basic reproductive number (R0) during the Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico, studying the immune system dynamics concerning Visceral Leishmaniasis and co-infections using a Bayesian joint model of longitudinal and survival data, and implementing a Bayesian modular framework to control and interrupt the transmission cycle of Lyme disease by integrating disease processes and capture-recapture events. Some of my nonbiomedical research interests revolve around promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM education. I am dedicated to addressing the underrepresentation of minority students in STEM disciplines and improving statistics education. Additionally, he explores and implements strategies to enhance the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students from diverse backgrounds.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any collaborative research project regarding infectious disease modeling and educational projects.
