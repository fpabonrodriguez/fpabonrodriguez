- 👋 Hi, my name is Felix Pabon-Rodriguez, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science at Indiana University School of Medicine. In addition, I am an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Informatics at the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. 
- 👀 My biomedical research focuses on Bayesian approaches for within- and between-host modeling of infectious disease processes. Some of my research work includes the estimation of epidemiological parameters for the Zika virus, the study of immune system dynamics concerning Visceral Leishmaniasis and Lyme Disease, and the impact of co-infections via a Bayesian joint model of longitudinal and survival data. In addition, I am interested in addressing health disparities, with a focus on communicable and non-communicable diseases. Some of my nonbiomedical research interests revolve around promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM education. I am dedicated to addressing the underrepresentation of minority students in STEM disciplines and improving statistics education. Additionally, I aim to explore and implement strategies to enhance the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students from diverse backgrounds.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any collaborative research project regarding infectious disease modeling and educational projects.
